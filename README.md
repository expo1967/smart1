# smart1
the beginnings of a smart contract


* the code is hardcoded to use the string "pizza" as the encryption key for passwords

The CGI script is smart.cgi
- in this script you must modify the call to mysql_connect_to_db() to pass the appropriate values for
  -- schema
  -- username
  -- password
  -- if needed change the hostname from 127.0.0.1 to whatever is needed

The command line interface is smart.pl
